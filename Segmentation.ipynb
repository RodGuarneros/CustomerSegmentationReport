    "Create a customer segmentation report based on census information and e-mail sales by a company, using demographic information to determine how customers are different to general population. Then use this analysis to make predictions to figure out wich members of the general population are more lekely to become a customer for the e-mail order company, <b>based on a unsupervised machine learning model</b>.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).\n",
    "- Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv: Demographics data for customers of a mail order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).\n",
    "- Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).\n",
    "- Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. Use the information from the first two files to figure out how customers (\"CUSTOMERS\") are similar or different from the general population at large (\"AZDIAS\"), then use your analysis to make predictions on the other two files (\"MAILOUT\"), predicting which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"CUSTOMERS\" file contains three extra columns ('CUSTOMER_GROUP', 'ONLINE_PURCHASE', and 'PRODUCT_GROUP'), which provide broad information about the customers depicted in the file. The original \"MAILOUT\" file included one additional column, <b>\"RESPONSE\"</b>, which indicated whether or not each recipient became a customer of the company. For the \"TRAIN\" subset, this column has been retained, but in the \"TEST\" subset it has been removed; it is against that withheld column that your final predictions will be assessed in the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, all of the remaining columns are the same between the three data files. For more information about the columns depicted in the files, you can refer to two Excel spreadsheets provided in the workspace. One of them is a top-level list of attribuxtes and descriptions, organized by informational category. The other is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.\n",
